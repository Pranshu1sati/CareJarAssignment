This repository contains the proof of work for the internship assignment task for the role of Fullstack Developer Intern at CareJar. The task involves creating a Single Page Application (SPA) with two sections: one for selecting the type of doctor and the other for displaying a list of doctors of the selected type. The SPA is built with React.

In the first section, users have the option to choose the type of doctor. Upon selection, they move to the next section, where data is dynamically fetched using a slug from an Express API. This API retrieves data from a MongoDB database. The backend for this API is located in the 'backend' folder and is deployed on Render. The provided link below can be used to access it.
